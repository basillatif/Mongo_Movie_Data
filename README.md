# Mongo_Movie_Data

Project Description
The goal of this project is to help people find good movies to watch. This project will use MongoDB. Potential users will be my friends and family. 

Data Description
The data that will be stored is rows of movies and columns that have attributes of the movies. Some of the columns are dictionaries while others are numbers or strings. 

5 Examples of Data
A user will be able to find the highest rated movie within a genre he likes within the last 5 years
A user will be able to see which are the most popular secret agent movies.
A user will be able to see the taglines of movies that he likes within a genre.

A user will be able to see which movies have made the most money. 

Schema of the Database
Since I am using Mongo, each row of the table will be a document.
